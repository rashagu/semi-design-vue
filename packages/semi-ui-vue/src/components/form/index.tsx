/**
 * The early design of Semi Form was inspired by informed （https://github.com/joepuzzo/informed） and formik（https://github.com/formium/formik）
 * The informed API design is very concise, and formik has very clear naming of the form status.
 * However, due to the requirements of convenient scalability (we need to split into F/A architecture), in additional they have their own binding verification library,
 * we cannot directly reuse such libraries.
 * So we fully absorbed these excellent api designs. Combining the technical principles of the two to implement our own code,
